#![no_std]

//!Moonboot is a framework to build bootloaders for embedded devices, or other kinds of no_std
//!Rust environments.
//!
//!This crate contains implementations, macros and build.rs helpers for:
//!* Partitioning of your memory into different sections
//!* Exchange of the contents of those partitions via the bootloader
//!* Signature/Checksum-checking of the partitions contents with an algorithm of your choice, because it is
//!done in firmware, not in bootloader
//!* Automatic Linker Script generation based on a Section/Parition Description in Rust Code

/// Implementations for use in the bootloader

/// Common hardware abstractions and associated implementations
